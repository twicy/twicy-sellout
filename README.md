In this work, we build and train a convolutional neural network for deepfake recognition. To achieve this goal, we obtain our data set from a StyleGan based deepfake image generating website, \url{Which face is real? http://www.whichfaceisreal.com/}[3]. We further test with 4 models, VGG, VGG-BN, Meso4 and Meso4Inception. We evaluated these models, and the test demonstrate a successful detecting rate with more than 80\% for VGG-BN and Meso4.
